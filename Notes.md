# Points

~ React Native is build on the React that was build by facebook.
~ React Native is used to Develop the mobile application in React environment.
~ It can build application for both `Android` as well as `ios` by same code.

# Problems in Traditional Development
    - Cross Platform Development -> more time consumption
    - Code Reusability -> can't use for different codes
    - Requiements for Develop and Deploy -> Editors like android studio and swift.

# Can't Solve by React Native
    - Specialized Modules (Modules doesn't support for all requirements)
    - Highly Custom UI (complex layout may affect or differ for different devices) 
    - Performance-Intensive (Not suitable for more intensize graphic development)
